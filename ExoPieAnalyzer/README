## analyzer code here 

The analysis code is mainly written in the monoHbbAnalyzer.py file. This will create a .root file with trees for each CR/SR. 



### How to run 

''' python monoHbbAnalyzer.py '''



The output tree can be used to make 

1. the histogram and then make stack plots using the same framework used earlier. 

2. use tree to make the stack plots using matplotlib (it is possible but slightly tricky to make divide canvas) 

3. use tree to do the optimisation of one of the variable one might need. You have to remove cut on this variable and save in the rootfile. 


For 1. i.e. make histogram use the script DataFrameToHisto.py, which save histogram in a .root file. 

### How to run 

''' python DataFrameToHisto.py '''
